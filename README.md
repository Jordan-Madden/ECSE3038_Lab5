# ECSE3038 Lab 5

This lab is meant to acclimate students to the technlogies used in designing a  HTML frontend for a RESTful API Server.

## Requirements
The previous 2 labs allowed the student to design a functional RESTful API server, so the tasks left are to design a use friendly GUI 
for the tank storage application. This frontend app should be used to allow a user to interface with the kind of data that the backend 
server is mean to handle. The app should provide a user with a simple form that accepts the various attributes of of a tank object. This
form should come with a button that allows a POST request to the server and the frontend should make a GET request to a server and dynamically
add cards (with tank data) to the screen.


The design of the frontend is up to the user. A title should be added at the top of the page and the HTML, CSS and JS files should be separate.
